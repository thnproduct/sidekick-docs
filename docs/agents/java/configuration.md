# Installation

Follow the below steps to install Sidekick SDK to your application.

* Download the latest Sidekick agent from the Sidekick [repo](https://repo.thundra.io/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=sidekick-releases\&g=com.runsidekick.agent\&a=sidekick-agent-bootstrap\&v=LATEST).
* Configure the agent via [environment variable](configuration.md#configure-by-environment-variable) or [configuration file](configuration.md#configure-by-yaml-format).
* Add Sidekick agent to the application by setting the `-javaagent` VM argument

## Download the Agent

Download the latest Sidekick agent from this link [repo](https://repo.thundra.io/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=sidekick-releases\&g=com.runsidekick.agent\&a=sidekick-agent-bootstrap\&v=LATEST).

## Configure the Agent

In order to configure the agent, you'll need an API key from Sidekick. You can see your API key in the [Welcome Tab](../../plugins/sidekick-web-ide/introduction/code-panel.md#welcome-tab). 

### Configure by Environment Variable

The Sidekick agent can be configured externally through environment variables:

* Configure the Sidekick API key by setting the `SIDEKICK_APIKEY` environment variable. This configuration is mandatory.
* Configure application name by setting the `SIDEKICK_AGENT_APPLICATION_NAME` environment variable. This configuration is mandatory.
* Configure the application stage (local, dev, lab, staging, prod, etc.) by setting the`SIDEKICK_AGENT_APPLICATION_STAGE` environment variable. This configuration is optional.
* Configure application version (1.0.0, 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT, etc.) by setting the`SIDEKICK_AGENT_APPLICATION_VERSION` environment variable. This configuration is optional.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also enable distributed tracing by integrating Thundra APM agent as explained [here](https://apm.docs.thundra.io/java/integration-options-for-containers-and-vms). Note that, to be able to use Thundra APM agent, you need to have a separate Thundra APM account which you can get it [here](https://apm.thundra.io/).

When you enable distributed tracing with Thundra APM agent, tracepoint snapshot events will be correlated to active traces at the time of tracepoint snapshot has been taken. So you will be able to go to the related traces from the tracepoint snapshot event to understand what did happen in the system during the execution of overall flow/transaction.
{% endhint %}

So, a sample configuration will look like this:

```
export SIDEKICK_APIKEY=<YOUR-SIDEKICK-API-KEY> 
export SIDEKICK_AGENT_APPLICATION_NAME=user-service
export SIDEKICK_AGENT_APPLICATION_STAGE=dev
export SIDEKICK_AGENT_APPLICATION_VERSION=1.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

### Configure by YAML format

Sidekick agent can be configured through a YAML formatted configuration file named `sidekick-config.yml` in the classpath (for example the config file might be located under `src/main/resources` directory):

* Configure the Sidekick API key by setting the `sidekick.apiKey` YAML key. This configuration is mandatory.
* Configure the application name by setting the`sidekick.agent.application.name` YAML key. This configuration is mandatory.
* Configure the application stage (local, dev, lab, staging, prod, etc.) by setting the`sidekick.agent.application.stage` YAML key. This configuration is optional.
* Configure the application version (1.0.0, 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT, etc.) by setting the `sidekick.agent.application.version` YAML key. This configuration is optional.

So, a sample configuration file `sidekick-config.yml` will look like this:

```yaml
sidekick:
 apiKey: <YOUR-SIDEKICK-API-KEY>
 agent:
   application:
     name: user-service
     stage: dev
     version: 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT

```

### Sample Docker Configuration

Here you can see a sample Docker configuration. It may differ from your own Docker configuration. **You need to modify this sample according to your own Docker configuration.**

```bash
FROM openjdk:8
RUN mkdir -p /app

# Copy app artifact
ADD target/<Your-App>.jar /app/<Your-App>.jar

# Copy Sidekick bootstrap agent artifact. 
# Please rename with the file you have downloaded at the first step.
ADD sidekick-agent-bootstrap.jar /app/sidekick-agent-bootstrap.jar

WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT [ "java", "-javaagent:sidekick-agent-bootstrap.jar", "-jar", "<Your-App>.jar" ]
```

You can use the example below if you would like to use environment variables with `docker run`

```
docker run ... \ 
    -e SIDEKICK_APIKEY=<YOUR-SIDEKICK-API-KEY> \
    -e SIDEKICK_AGENT_APPLICATION_NAME=<YOUR-APP-NAME> \
    -e SIDEKICK_AGENT_APPLICATION_STAGE=dev \
    -e SIDEKICK_AGENT_APPLICATION_VERSION=1.0.1-SNAPSHOT \
    ...
```

## Add Sidekick to Your Application

Run the following command to add Sidekick to your application.

```bash
java -javaagent:<path-to-sidekick-agent> -jar <your-app-jar> ...
```
