# Introduction to Web Application

This guide explains the components of Sidekick's Web Application.

Sidekick lets developers debug their remote applications without stopping. In this "Debug" view, our users can find everything they need to debug a remote application with tracepoints. Let's dive into the different parts of the application together

There are four main components in Debug view:

* [Source Panel](source-panel.md)
* [Code Panel](code-panel.md)
* [Apps and Tracepoints Panel](apps-and-tracepoints-panel.md)
* [Events Table](events-panel.md)
