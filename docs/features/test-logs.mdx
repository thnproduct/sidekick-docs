Logs are still one of the best ways of debugging your software. When it comes to writing log lines,
you end up getting lost in the GitHub Actions results. Foresight eases your pain and group tests, test suites along with their logs.

So that you can understand why even the most complex integration test failed, without losing your way on the GitHub Actions.

With the below configurations, you can start displaying your logs on the Foresight.

## JUnit

#### Maven Surefire plugin
If you are using Maven Surefire to run tests, Foresight automatically captures 
the logs ```<system-out>``` and ```<system-err>``` fields in your tests.

:::info
Your Surefire version needs to be >=3.0.0-M5.
:::

For more information, please refer:
- [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE-1744](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE-1744)
- [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.maven.plugins/maven-surefire-plugin](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.maven.plugins/maven-surefire-plugin)

#### Gradle
If you are using Gradle, Foresight automatically captures 
the logs ```<system-out>``` and ```<system-err>``` fields in your tests.

You need to have ```reports``` section on your test section. 

```
test {
   useJUnitPlatform()
   reports {
       junitXml {
           outputPerTestCase = true // defaults to false
           mergeReruns = true // defaults to false
       }
   }
}
```

## TestNG 
In addition to your `system` logs, if you are using TestNG's test reporter,
Foresight captures:

```java
Reporter.log("LOG_CONTENT")
```


## Jest
Foresight can parse JUnit formatted test reports. For Jest framework, you can use **jest-junit** reporter for generate Junit reports.
If you are using Jest, you need to configure your report settings for Foresight to capture your test results.

#### Set an env variable
You need to set the following environment

```javascript
JEST_JUNIT_INCLUDE_SHORT_CONSOLE_OUTPUT=true
```

#### Configuring reporter
Add reporter parameter ```jest-junit``` to your Jest configuration or your command.

```javascript
--reporters="jest-junit"
```

:::info
Your Jest version needs to be >=6.4.0
:::

## Pytest
Pytest automatically generates a JUnit test report if you add the following to your command.

```xml
--junit-xml=reportname.xml
```

In addition, you need to add the below to enable logging if your Pytest version is `>=3.5.0`.
```xml
-o junit_logging=all
```

Example command:
```
pytest -o junit_logging=all --junit-xml=abc.xml 
```


## Trx 

:::warning
You can configure  **ITestOutputHelper** for capture test logs help with this guide [https://xunit.net/docs/capturing-output](https://xunit.net/docs/capturing-output)
:::

Foresight captures the following outputs from your test report:
```xml
<Output>
    <StdOut>This is output from my class!</StdOut>
</Output>
```

## XUnit2 

:::warning
You can configure **ITestOutputHelper** for capture test logs help with this guide [https://xunit.net/docs/capturing-output](https://xunit.net/docs/capturing-output)
:::

Foresight captures the following outputs from your test report:
```xml
<output>This is output from my class MyTest2!</output>
